#### _1. What is your issue of interest?_
 
My issue of interest is to detect lung cancer using different health and environment related aspects of a person. One of the most prevalent diseases that is affected in its early stages to increase the likelihood that patients will survive is lung disease. The hardest aspect for the radiologist is making the cancer diagnosis. A smart computer-aided system is tremendously beneficial to radiologists. several research using ML algorithms to identify lung cancer.
#### _2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?_

These days, number of patients having lung related problems are increasing. And due to various reasons, number of people susceptible to lung cancer is increasing. However, it is costly and difficult to perform cancer tests to all these people. So, a model which can detect lung cancer just by inputting few identifiable things would reduce the cost a lot by reducing the number of patients to test.
