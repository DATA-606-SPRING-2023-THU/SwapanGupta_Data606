## Project Title: Lung Cancer Detection
## Author: Swapan Gupta Chollati(RJ29255)

#### _1. What is your issue of interest?_
 
My issue of interest is to detect lung cancer using different health and environment related aspects of a person. One of the most prevalent diseases that is affected in its early stages to increase the likelihood that patients will survive is lung disease. The hardest aspect for the radiologist is making the cancer diagnosis. A smart computer-aided system is tremendously beneficial to radiologists. several research using ML algorithms to identify lung cancer.
#### _2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?_

These days, number of patients having lung related problems are increasing. And due to various reasons, number of people susceptible to lung cancer is increasing. However, it is costly and difficult to perform cancer tests to all these people. So, a model which can detect lung cancer just by inputting few identifiable things would reduce the cost a lot by reducing the number of patients to test.

#### _3. What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?_

What kind of models can be used?
What measure can I use to compare the models?
How can I handle data with more dimensionality?

#### _4. Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions_
##### DataSource: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sripadkarthik/lung-cancer-prediction-using-ml-and-dl/data
The Dataset consist of about 1000 rows and 26 columns 

#### _5. What will be your unit of analysis_
The unit of analysis is a patient
The dataset has 1000 units of analysis

#### _6.What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis_

**Below are the variables I am considering for analysis:
- Age
- Gender
- Air Pollution 
- Alcohol use
- Dust Allergy
- OccuPational Hazards
- Genetic Risk
- chronic Lung Disease
- Balanced Diet
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Passive Smoker
- Chest Pain
- Coughing of Blood
- Fatigue
- Weight Loss
- Shortness of Breath
- Wheezing
- Swallowing Difficulty
- Clubbing of Finger Nails
- Frequent Cold
- Dry Cough
- Snoring

#### _7.What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use_
I will be using dimensionality reduction techniques as the number of columns are more and rows a are less
I will use classification techniques like
	- Logistic regression
	- Decision tree etc
	- SVM
I will compare each algorithm and select the best one.
